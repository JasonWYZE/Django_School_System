## About The Project

In this project, I build a school system, a canvas-like system, using Django and react. Basically, it should allow multiple users to log in to this website. Professor can post assignment, notice, and edit student information on this website.In order to start with this project, I learn Django and react through official tutorial. You need to set up the virtual python environment and download django and react to process the project.
  
  
### Built With
  * [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
  * [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

  
  
<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
In two different shell and one should with virtual python environment.In the virtual python environment:
  ```python
python manage.py runserver
  ```
Make sure you cd frontend before starting the react app. In another shell, enter:
  ```python
  npm start
  ```

## Reflection

However, this project is not prefect. Due to time issue, I did not set up the user authentication when signing the account. Another problem is that I want to build the frontend as an index page so user can access other routes or pages. The problem is that I design django as an API, which means it only works for storing data and access data to frontend, which is react. The purpose is to making the website can run faster since it does not need to handle all the data in either frontend or backend. However, I get problem that the frontend can get data from backend when I change to other pages. This project is more about how to learn something new by myself and I found out it is really helpful to follow the steps on the official tutorial and some youtube videos. I also learn a lot from others project, which help me further understand the principle behind it. Besides, this project also let me know the importance of overall system design. In the future(probably this summer), I will keep updating this project to add more functions on it and solve the problems I encounter on frontend.
