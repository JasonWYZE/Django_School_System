<h1>Django and React Project<h1>
<br>
<p>In this project, I am going to build a website, a canvas-like system, using Django and react. Basically, it should allow multiple users to log in to this website. Basically, a teacher can create assignments that students can do and view the grade after they finished. In order to finish this project, I need to start to learn Django and react. Therefore, there is the schedule I set up for myself.<p>
<br>


<ol>
    <li>4.11 - 4.17 Learning Django and React</li>
    <li>4.18 - 4.25 Start to build website framework (Use login system, add notice, and many functions by Django)</li>
    <li>4.25 - 5.2 React for the front end of website</li>
</ol>
<br>

<p>However, there are still some risks in my project. For example, I may have problems in self-learning Django and React since I am afraid that I am not able to learn both of them in a short period of time. Some topics like dictionary and list when I am implmentig the database for the usersâ€™ information<p>
