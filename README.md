<h1>Django & React School System Project<h1>
<br>
<p>In this project, I build a school system, a canvas-like system, using Django and react. Basically, it should allow multiple users to log in to this website. Professor can post assignment, notice, and edit student information on this website.In order to start with this project, I learn Django and react through official tutorial. You need to set up the virtual python environment and download django and react to process the project<p>
<br>

```python
import Django
import React

python manage.py runserver
npm start

```

<p>However, this project is not prefect. Due to time issue, I did not set up the user authentication when signing the account. Another problem is that I want to build the frontend as an index page so user can access other routes or pages. The problem is that I design django as an API, which means it only works for storing data and access data to frontend, which is react. The purpose is to making the website can run faster since it does not need to handle all the data in either frontend or backend. However, I get problem that the frontend can get data from backend when I change to other pages.</p>
<br>

<p>However, there are still some risks in my project. For example, I may have problems in self-learning Django and React since I am afraid that I am not able to learn both of them in a short period of time. Some topics like dictionary and list when I am implmentig the database for the usersâ€™ information<p>
